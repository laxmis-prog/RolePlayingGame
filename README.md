This is a RolePlayingGame project I created as part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum. 
I learnt fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. I learnt how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
